The OH-EpiCap tool aims to develop system-specific profiles of (potential) surveillance interoperability between sectors, highlighting both strengths and gaps in surveillance capacities and capabilities. 

The OH-EpiCap tool allows evaluation and improvement of ‘One Health (OH)-ness’ using a set of standardized indicators, which allows comparison across systems, countries and hazards of interest. Countries at similar levels of ‘OH-ness’, including similar capacities, limitations and resources, can potentially collaborate to develop a common framework for OH Surveillance that will address zoonotic threats across borders. This will improve national OH structures, including surveillance and data analysis, while also facilitating better integration of multinational collaboration. Countries at different levels of ‘OH-ness’ and surveillance capacity/resources can share experiences regarding surveillance practice against the same pathogen, transfer knowledge and share ideas to improve surveillance quality and efficacy across settings.

The OH-EpiCap tool facilitates discussion between surveillance representatives from different disciplines and programs, encouraging a more collaborative OH approach. It is based on a standalone interactive web-based application, which allows a panel with representatives from all sectors within the system being evaluated to complete an in-country surveillance evaluation. The tool focuses on evaluating “One Heath-ness” across three dimensions:
* Dimension 1: Organization of the OH surveillance system
* Dimension 2: OH-ness in operational activities of the OH surveillance system
* Dimension 3: Impact of the OH surveillance system

Some of the features of the tool include:
* Evaluation of 'OH-ness' across the three dimensions
* Interactive visualisation of results
* Benchmarking tool to compare to other One Health Surveillance systems

The OH-EpiCap tool has been developed by the MATRIX consortium, a joint integrative project funded by the One Health European Joint Programme. The MATRIX consortium aims to advance the implementation of OH surveillance in practice, by building onto existing resources, adding value to them, and creating synergies among the sectors at the national level. One activity has been the development of the generic benchmarking tool presented here, for characterizing, monitoring, and evaluating epidemiological surveillance capacities and capabilities, which directly contribute to OH surveillance. The tool aims to identify and describe the collaborations among actors involved in the surveillance of a hazard and to characterize the OH-ness of the surveillance system. The tool will support identification of areas that could lead to improvements in existing OH surveillance capacities.
